    "\n",
    "Generally, by the time we're ready to have a notebook accessed, used, or just read by others we've spent a good deal of time running code cells and navigating back to sections to make changes or improvements. One result of this is we have developed a non-intuitive understanding of where everything is; not only is it sensible to us because we made it from scratch, but it almost doesn't matter to us if it is disorganised because we've spent so much time \"practicing\" navigating the document. For this reason, it can be hard to recognize the need for structure and organisation, so it's better to build it in by design!\n",
    "\n",
    "This means two things in terms of notebooks. First, using standard markdown correctly will mean that in many environments an easily navigable outline will be readily available to readers without any extra work (jupyterlab, vscode extension, colab, etc...). This may not be the case in every environment, and most certainly will not transalate to any static export of your notebook (pdf, html, etc...). For this reason, it's advisable to also use sensible html anchor tags to facilitate orgaizing and moving around even under conditions without automatic outlines parsed from markdown."

    "Using *expressive* variable names is nothing new. If we can't really tell what something is when we read it, that adds extra cognitive load to a situation unnecessarily. For example, if I have a raw dataset in a notebook withe the variable name ```df``` and a cleaned version in the same notebook with the name ```data``` I must remember this convention to recognise when the raw or cleaned data is being used. This really isn't a standard convention, so names that contained that information would be a bit more useful - ```df_raw``` and ```df_clean``` would be an improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't the only way we can make better variable names however. Particularly in interactive environments like jupyter, it an save a lot of time to take advantage of variable completion features. Remeber the ```df_raw``` and ```df_clean``` variables? Notive that they start with the same three letters? If instead we called them ```raw_df``` and ```clean_df``` our variable completion feature would work better and with much less information."

    "Cell assertions allow for a kind of testing to be part of standard notebook composition practice. While not intended to replace more comprehensive and formalised kinds of testing, making yourself write a meaningful cell assertion is a good practice for two reasons. First, it helps reinforce the purpose of a cell. While this can always be done with comments, bloating code with non-functional text is rarely necessaary and because it doesn't actually affirm what is being said, it's possible for comments to be misleading. Cell asserts are also a great way to combat one of the problems characterstic of a cell execution format, namely that if things are done out of order for some reason the unexpected may occur. It's also a good idea to check for any critical version pegs using asserts at the outset."
